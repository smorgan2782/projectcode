    <h1> Self-Care Ideas for the Soul </h1>
                    

    <li>Imagine you’re your best friend. If you were, what would you tell yourself right now? Look in the mirror and say it.</li>

   <li>Use your commute for a “Beauty Scavenger Hunt.” Find five unexpected beautiful things on your way to work.</li>

   <li>Help someone. Carry a bag, open a door, or pick up an extra carton of milk for a neighbor.</li>

      <li>Check in with your emotions. Sit quietly and just name without judgment what you’re feeling.</li>

   <li>Write out your thoughts. Go for fifteen minutes on anything bothering you. Then let it go as you burn or bin the paper.</li>

     <li>Choose who you spend your time with today. Hang out with “Radiators” who emit enthusiasm and positivity, and not “Drains” whose pessimism and negativity robs energy.</li>

    <li>Stroke a pet. If you don’t have one, go to the park and find one. (Ask first!)</li>

   <li>Get positive feedback. Ask three good friends to tell you what they love about you.</li>

       <li>Make a small connection. Have a few sentences of conversation with someone in customer service such as a sales assistant or barista.</li>

   <li>Splurge a little. Buy a small luxury as a way of valuing yourself.</li>

    <li>Have a self-date. Spend an hour alone doing something that nourishes you (reading, your hobby, visiting a museum or gallery, etc.)</li>

    <li>Exercise a signature strength. Think about what you’re good at, and find an opportunity for it today.</li>

      <li>Take an at-home spa day. Have a long bath or shower, sit around in your bathrobe, and read magazines. Get your favorite skincare products and take time to do your skin regimen. Burn a candle, put on soft music and relax. </li>

   <li>Ask for help—big or small, but reach out.</li>

      <li>Plan a two-day holiday for next weekend. Turn off your phone, tell people you’ll be away, and then do something new in your own town.</li>
