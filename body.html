	<h1>Self-Care Ideas for the Body</h1>


<li>Give your body ten minutes of mindful attention. Use the body scan technique to check in with each part of your body.</li>

<li>Oxygenate by taking three deep breaths. Breathe into your abdomen, and let the air puff out your stomach and chest.</li>

<li>Get down and just dance. Put on your favorite upbeat record and shake your booty.</li>

<li>Stretch out the kinks. If you’re at work, you can always head to the bathroom to avoid strange looks.</li>

<li>Run (or walk, depending on your current physical health) for a few minutes. Or go up and down the stairs three times.</li>

<li>Narrow your food choices. Pick two healthy breakfasts, lunches, and dinners and rotate for the week.</li>

<li>Activate your self-soothing system. Stroke your own arm, or if that feels too weird, moisturize.</li>

<li>Get to know yourself intimately. Look lovingly and without judgment at yourself naked. (Use a mirror to make sure you get to know all of you!)</li>

<li>Make one small change to your diet for the week. Drink an extra glass of water each day, or have an extra portion of veggies each meal.</li>

<li>Give your body a treat. Pick something from your wardrobe that feels great next to your skin.</li>

<li>Be still. Sit somewhere green, and be quiet for a few minutes.</li>

<li>Get fifteen minutes of sun, especially if you’re in a cold climate. (Use sunscreen if appropriate.)</li>

<li>Inhale an upbeat smell. Try peppermint to suppress food cravings and boost mood and motivation.</li>

<li>Have a good laugh. Watch some funny videos online or a good comedy on Netflix.</li>

<li>Take a quick nap. Ten to twenty minutes can reduce your sleep debt and leave you ready for action.</li>
